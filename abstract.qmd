To establish effective forest restoration strategies and climate targets, it is essential to understand the factors affecting forest regrowth. Land use history is especially significant, as roughly one-third of Neotropic regrowth happens on soil formerly used for agriculture. The fertility of those soils is determined strongly by previous land use practices, impacting forest regeneration rates. Despite their importance, these factors remain unexplored by regrowth models, which have focused on environmental predictors. **My research focuses on improving our current estimates of carbon accumulation in Neotropical secondary forests by considering the effects of land use history.** Implementing 33 years of remotely sensed land use maps and recent global carbon storage data, I am building a semi-mechanistic regrowth model for the Brazilian Amazon given environmental and anthropogenic predictors. Subsequently, in collaboration with STRI scientists, I will apply in Panama the machine learning-based land use classification method that was applied to Brazil, generating new land use history maps and allowing for the implementation of the model in Panama. This allows for validation of the model with STRI data from wet and dry secondary forest plots, and opens doors for the implementation of probability of deforestation to more efficient conservation strategies and sustainable land use policies in the Neotropical region.
